# üìà Stock Market Real-Time Data Analysis Using Apache Kafka

This is an **end-to-end real-time data engineering project** designed to simulate, stream, store, and analyze stock market data using Apache Kafka and AWS cloud services.

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate stock market data, stream it using **Apache Kafka**, store it in **Amazon S3**, and query it using **Amazon Athena**. This architecture mirrors real-world data streaming systems used in financial analytics, IoT, and event-driven platforms.

**Main Components:**

- **Python Producer:** Simulates real-time stock data from a CSV file
- **Apache Kafka (EC2):** Handles message streaming (Producer ‚Üí Topic ‚Üí Consumer)
- **Kafka Consumer:** Consumes the stream and uploads to Amazon S3
- **AWS S3:** Acts as a Data Lake
- **AWS Glue Crawler & Data Catalog:** Automates schema discovery
- **Amazon Athena:** Runs SQL queries directly on S3 data
